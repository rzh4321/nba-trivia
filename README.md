## What I Learned

1. **TypeScript + React:** This project marked my first time ever using TypeScript, and it was an excellent opportunity to learn and apply strong typing to my code. Integrating TypeScript with React provided me with a deeper understanding of both technologies and how they can work together.

2. **React Optimizations:** I only knew how React.memo and the useCallback worked in theory, but I had never applied them. These optimizations not only improved the overall performance of the application but also introduced me to best practices for writing efficient React code.
